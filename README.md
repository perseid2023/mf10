Fix cutscene video on certain games that GE-Proton can't fix yet.

For example : Omega Quintet, Mugen Souls Z, and Fairy Fencer F ADF.

Tested with GE-Proton10-10

Don't forget to register the msmpeg2vdec after importing all of the reg files.
Or just run the mf10.exe inside your prefix to skip all of the hustle (not work on original proton because of the symlink thingy).
