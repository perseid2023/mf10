Fix cutscene video on certain games that GE-Proton can't fix yet.
For example : Omega Quintet, Mugen Souls Z, and Fairy Fencer F ADF.
Tested with GE-Proton10-10 and Wine10.
Will be updated if I found and manage to fix another game with codec issue.

Don't forget to register the msmpeg2vdec afte importing all of the reg files.
Or just run the mf10.exe inside prefix to skip all of the hustle (not work on original proton because of the symlink thingy).
